This project is based off the ARDUINO UNO WiFi REV2 board and has the following goals:
	-Getting familiar with Kicad Schematic capture and PCB layout
	-Basic surface mount soldering
	-Implementing python client to configure and interact with uC

Features:
	-Simple communications between uC and python client via:
		-UART over usb
		-UDP packets via wireless network
	-Use of CRC based error checking for incomming and outgoing packets
	-Button input (push and latching) with debouncing + pulse count
	-RTC clock via I2C to configure system time at start-up
	-Implementation of Alarms
		-ON_OFF or Cycle/Period modes
	-4 x DS1820B digital temperature sensors via Dallas One-Wire protocol
	-2 x analog inputs for basic sensors [0-5V @20mA max]
	-4 x outputs to control 120VAC with SSR relays
	-4 x optocoupler isolated outputs to control 12VDC
	-Dividing code in Tasks
		-Communications
		-Temperature conversion cycles
		-Input IO Finite State machines for detecting states
		-Analog sensor sampling
		-Wifi connection monitoring
		-System time synch refresh once day
